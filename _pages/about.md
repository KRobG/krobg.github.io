<div style="text-align: justify">I am a PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm under the supervision of <a href="http://www.csc.kth.se/~fpokorny/" style="text-decoration:none">Florian T. Pokorny</a>. My research is supported by <a href="https://wasp-sweden.org" style="text-decoration:none">WASP</a>, the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program. Previously I was a researcher at the Institute of Medical Technology and Intelligent Systems at Technical University of Hamburg (TUHH). I received my M.Sc. in Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence from Technical University of Munich (TUM).<br>

I am particularly interested in <b>representation learning</b> and <b>reinforcement learning</b> for applications in robotics and computer vision. At the moment, I am  investigating how to advance the manipulation of <b>deformable objects</b>. Compared to rigid objects, this task is particularly challenging due to high-dimensional observations, complicated perception and highly non-linear mechanics.</div>
