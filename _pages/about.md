I am a PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm under the supervision of Florian T. Pokorny. My research is supported by WASP, the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program. Previously I was researcher at the Institute of Medical Technology at Technical University of Hamburg (TUHH). I received a M.Sc. in Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence from Technical University of Munich (TUM).

I am interested in the development of novel machine learning methods for solving planning and control problems in robotics. Currently, I am  investigating how to advance the manipulation of deformable objects. Compared to rigid object, this task is particularly challenging due to high-dimensional configuration spaces, complicated perception and highly non-linear mechanics.
