I am a PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm under the supervision of [Florian T. Pokorny](http://www.csc.kth.se/~fpokorny/). My research is supported by [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org), the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program. Previously I was a researcher at the Institute of Medical Technology at Technical University of Hamburg (TUHH). I received my M.Sc. in Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence from Technical University of Munich (TUM).

I am interested in the development of novel machine learning methods for solving planning and control problems in robotics. Currently, I am  investigating how to advance the manipulation of deformable objects. Compared to rigid objects, this task is particularly challenging due to high-dimensional configuration spaces, complicated perception and highly non-linear mechanics.
